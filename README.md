# PGDDS-IIIT-Bangalore

This repository includes the projects that I am working on during my PG Diploma in Data Science. I've included the python scripts with detailed comments and pdf files for consolidated presentations wherever applicable. 

Please Note: If you are a current or future student of the PGDDS program offered by IIIT-Bangalore. I encourage you to ask questions and ask for clarifications. However, I strongly discourage you from integrating sections of the code for your submissions. Every submission is evaluated by a plagiarism checker and they have a very strict policy for plagiarism.

## Project Description:

#### [1] Spark Fund Case Study : 
Spark Funds, an asset management company wants to make investments in a few companies. Hence, to understand the global trends in investments, real investment data is collected from crunchbase.com. The objective was to perform exploratory analysis to find sectors and countries in which the company should invest based on given parameters.

#### [2] Uber Supply Demand Case Study :
Uber Technologies Inc. face a loss of potential revenue due to supply shortages either caused by driver induced request cancellations or non-availability of cars. The objective was to perform exploratory data analysis using Python and Tableau to identify underlying patterns resulting in driver initiated cancellation and non-availability of taxis particularly for airport trips leading to loss of revenue for Uber.

#### [3] Credit Loss Analysis for Loan Application :
Performed exploratory data analysis using Python to detect the driving factors leading to loan default or credit loss thereby aiding in portfolio and risk assessment.

#### [4] Predict Automobile Pricing :
Developed a regression model to predict the price of cars in the American automobile market with 90.6% accuracy by analyzing physical and intangible attributes of the vehicle.

#### [5] Help NGO Case Study:
Performed dimensionality reduction using PCA and categorise the countries on socio-economic and health factors using Clustering to determine the overall development of a country and accordingly suggest the countries that needs immediate help from the NGO.

#### [6] Lead Score Case Study:
Developed a classification model for an online Education Company to predict the customers that are most likely to convert into paying customers with an accuracy of 81%.

#### [7] MNIST Digit Recognition:
Developed classification model using SVM and Random Forest to identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images.
